A small budget application with a twist. Written in Java, the idea was to create a simple budget app to keep track of income and expenses week-by-week.
The idea is to make sure there is money enough in the checking account to pay all bills when they become due. This is achieved by spreading the total 
sum of all bills out over the year.
